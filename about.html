                  <h3>The course</h3>
                  <p>The course is aimed at providing the necessary background and expertise for developing software applications supporting and enhancing artistic and creative performances, installations, etc. The course covers multi-modal applications, with particular emphasis on music production and performance.</p> 
                  <p>The first part of the course is devoted to developing methodologies for developing software devoted to multimodal interactive applications, involving various platforms of interest (e.g. EyesWeb, Supercollider, Processing, Openframework, ) based on a wide range of multimodal sensors (cameras, microphone arrays, Z-cameras, bio-sensors, motion sensors, etc.). </p>
                  <p>In the second part of the course, specific collaborative projects are developed in class and part of the classes is offered with innovative didactic modalities (e.g. "flipped classroom").</p>
                   
                  <h3>Teachers</h3>
                  <h4>Massimiliano Zanoni, Lecturer</h4>
                  <p>
                    He received my PhD degree in 2013 at the Politecnico di Milano University. For several years he was in charge of the coordination of the Music Information Retrieval section of the ISPL group at the Politecnico di Milano (Italy).  He was involved in the EU-founded project WholoDance (http://www.wholodance.eu) exploring the use of high-end technology (Mocap, VR/AR, Deep Learning, Interaction Design, Joint Music-Dance analysis) into dance practice.</p>
                  <p>
                    As creative technologist he is involved in research projects in the academia and in the creative industry. His main research interests include Creative Computing, Experience Design and Music Information Retrieval, with a particular focus on Artificial Intelligence. He is currently Creative Director and Interaction Designer at the O3lab, an artistic collective he co-founded in 2017.

                  <h4>Michele Buccoli, Teaching assistant</h4>
                  <p>
                    He received my PhD degree in 2017 at the Politecnico di Milano University under the co-supervision of Massimiliano Zanoni. 
                    He conducted his research on Music Information Retrieval tasks with machine-learning and deep-learning techniques. During the five years of doctorate and post-doc research, he has participated to several hackathons. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Since 2019 he works at BdSound for the development of speech-based solutions in embedded devices. He also co-supervise students for their Master thesis.

                  <h4>Luca Comanducci, Teaching assistant </h4>
                  <p> 
                    He received the B.S. degree in Music Information Science from the University of Milan, Milan, Italy, in 2014 and the M.S. degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy, in 2018, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in information engineering within the Dipartimento di Elettronica, Informazione and Bioingegneria. 
                  </p>
                    His main research interests concern the application of Deep Learning techniques to space-time audio signal problems and the development of techniques for Networked Music Performances.
                  </p>
                  <p> He has been involved as a researcher for the <a href="http://intermusicproject.eu/">INTERMusic project</a> and as a teaching assistant in the courses of Musical Acoustics and Creative Programming and Computing of the M.Sc. in Music and Acoustic Engineering.
